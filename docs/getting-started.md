# Getting started with Neversink

The theme depends on Slidev. So you need to have that [installed first](https://sli.dev/guide/install). Then you can install the theme with npm:

```bash
npm install slidev-theme-neversink
```

Then create a slidev markdown file (e.g., `slides.md`) and add the theme to the frontmatter of your first slide:

```md
---
theme: neversink
---
```

Then you are basically ready to go!

If you are new to Slidev highly recommend you check out the [Slidev documentation](https://sli.dev/) before diving in.
